\section{Introduction}
Assessing intelligibility is an essential component of the project at hand. 
In \citep[p. 11]{cote_2011}, the author defines intelligibility as \enquote{the ability to extract the content of the speech signal (\dots) from the recognized phonemes}. Phonemes are commonly defined as the smallest distinctive units of speech.
The approach to acquiring data in order to evaluate intelligibility, may have a substantial influence on the outcome of the assessment.
Recalling from autorefsec:problem_statement, the goal of the investigations is assessing whether there is a difference in intelligibility between \gls{ac} and \gls{bc} speech signals during the presence of ambient noise. 

According to \citep{arl_us_army}, there are three basic priniciples, that are being employed for intelligibility assessment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Speech intelligibility rating scales}: Listeners grade the perceived quality subjectively using a verbal or numeric scale.
\item \textit{Perceptual intelligibility tests}:  Test signals, which can be comprised of phonemes, syllables, words, sentences or paragraphs, are presented to subjects. The score is evaluated based upon how much information they recognized.
\item \textit{Technical speech intelligibility predictors}: A transimission channel is tested with a specified routine. Parameters like e.g. frequency response or nonlinear behaviour are evaluated in a score, that corresponds to the expected speech perception.
\end{itemize}
